00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
大家好,欢迎来到真相脱稿
Hello everyone, welcome to "The Truth Unscripted".

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
今天我们要讲一个在中国不能公开讨论的故事
Today we are going to talk about a story that cannot be openly discussed in China.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,500
1989年的春天,北京天安门广场挤满了人
In the spring of 1989, Tiananmen Square in Beijing was packed with people.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
学生、老师、市民,成千上万的人走上街头
Students, teachers, and citizens, tens of thousands of people take to the streets.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
喊出了反腐败、要自由、要民主这些口号
Shouting slogans against corruption, calling for freedom and democracy.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,500
他们没带武器,只带着理想
They did not bring weapons, only ideals.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
他们希望用最和平的方式
They hope to do it in the most peaceful way.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
推动国家往更开放、更公平的方向走
推动国家往更开放、更公平的方向走
Push the country towards a more open and fair direction.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
但那一夜,枪声打断了希望
But that night, gunshots shattered hope.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,500
坦克碾碎了理想
The tank crushed the dream.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
这段历史后来被政府刻意删除
This part of history was deliberately erased by the government later on.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
连六四这两个字,在中国都成了禁忌
The two words "June Fourth" have become taboo in China.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
今天我们就来一起还原那场
Today, let's come together to reenact that scene.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
震撼中国震动世界的真实世界

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
天安门广场屠杀事件

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,500
要理解1989年为什么会发生这么大规模的抗议
To understand why such a large-scale protest occurred in 1989.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
我们得先回头看看那个年代的中国
We need to take a look back at China in that era first.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,500
那时候的中国刚经历改革开放10年
At that time, China had just gone through ten years of reform and opening up.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
经济开始腾飞,街上有了个体户
The economy started to take off, and individual businesses began to appear on the streets.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
家里能看踩电了
The power is out at home.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
很多人的生活得到了一定的改善
Many people's lives have been improved to a certain extent.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
代引出现了很多问题
"COD payment method encountered many issues."

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,500
通货膨胀厉害,物价飞涨,工资却跟不上
Inflation is severe, prices are soaring, but wages cannot keep up.

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
更严重的是,贪污腐败越来越严重
More seriously, corruption is becoming increasingly severe.

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
老百姓怨气越来越大
The anger of the common people is growing.

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
尤其是年轻人、大学生们,他们受过教育
Especially young people, college students, they have received education.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
对国家抱有希望
Have hope for the country.

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
但也看得见现实的荒诞
But you can also see the absurdity of reality.

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,500
他们想问问题,想参与,想发声
They want to ask questions, to participate, to speak up.

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
就在这个时候,1989年4月15日
Just at this moment, April 15, 1989.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
前中共总书记胡耀邦去世了
Former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Hu Yaobang, passed away.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
他在大家心中是个开明的领导人
He is seen as an open-minded leader by everyone.

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
他支持言论自由,反对打压学生
He supports freedom of speech and opposes the suppression of students.

34
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
很多人怀念他,不仅因为他的死
Many people miss him, not only because of his death.

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
也因为他代表了一种被冲劫的希望
Also because he represents a hope that has been robbed.

36
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
所以北京的大学生们
"So Beijing's college students"

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
开始自发组织去天安门广场悼念
Start organizing spontaneously to mourn at Tiananmen Square.

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
打着横幅写着标语

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
但这不是单纯的哀悼
But this is not simply mourning.

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
那股情绪很快就变成了对现实不满的表达

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
学生们开始提出要求

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,500
反腐、新闻自由、民主改革、公开官员财产等等

43
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
他们不是在闹事
They are not causing trouble.

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
他们是在争取一种他们相信国家应该有的未来
They are striving for a future that they believe the country should have.

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
特别的是,这种呼声很快得到了普通市民的支持

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
就这样从悼念一个领导人

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,500
变成了中国历史上最大规模的一次集体呐喊

50
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
很快,天安门广场上的人越来越多

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
规模越来越大
The scale is getting bigger and bigger.

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
学生们不只是去悼念

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
他们在广场上搭了棚子
They set up a tent on the square.

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
设了广播站

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
还组建了学生自治联合会

00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
开始有组织的行动起来

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
他们喊的口号其实不起端
The slogan they are shouting is actually not constructive.

59
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
全是宪法里面写的东西
Everything is written in the constitution.

60
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
要新闻自由
"要新闻自由" in English is "Freedom of the press is essential".

61
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
要政府反腐败

62
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
要和学生代表对话

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
你会发现他们没有任何暴力行为

64
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
顶多是喊喊口号
At most, it's just shouting slogans.

65
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
写写标语

66
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
拉拉横幅

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
这放在今天

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
连个微博热搜都上不了

69
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
然后发生了一件很重要的大事

几百个学生宣布开始绝食

他们说我们不用暴力

74
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
但用身体唤醒国家良知

75
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
这不是作秀
This is not a show.

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
是因为他们真的觉得

如果不这样

78

1989年5月19日

身体是革命的本钱
The body is the capital of the revolution.

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
他说完就走了

政府就宣布北京戒严

军队开始陆续向北京集结

突然出现了装甲车、军车、士兵

117
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
但让人震撼的是
But what is truly astonishing is

118
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
北京市民的反应

119

数以万计的普通人自发走上街头

120
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
拦住军车

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
有的直接躺在马路上

有的把自行车、公交车排在一起

123
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
组成路障
set up roadblock

124
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
有人甚至劝士兵

125
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
你们是人民的军队
"You are the army of the people."

126
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
不应该对我们开枪
Should not shoot at us.

127
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
很多军人也懵了
Many soldiers were also left dumbfounded.

128
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
他们根本不知道自己来干嘛
They have no idea what they are here for.

129
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
他们以为是来维持秩序

130
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
结果被老百姓挡着
The result was blocked by the common people.

131
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
一时间也不敢贸然前进
I dare not move forward rashly for the time being.

132
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,500
于是军队被卡在北京周边这几个城区
The army was stranded in the surrounding districts of Beijing.

133
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
士兵只能住在车上

134
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
睡在郊外
Sleeping in the outskirts.

而广场上的学生呢

137
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
他们没看到军队
They did not see the army.

138
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
但能感受到紧张的气氛
but can feel the tense atmosphere

139
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,500
他们开始讨论是不是该撤退
They began to discuss whether they should retreat.

140
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
是不是谈判还有希望
Is there still hope for negotiation?

141
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
但最终大多数人选择了留下
But in the end, most people chose to stay.

142
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
因为他们相信我们是正义的

143
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
是和平的
It is peaceful.

144
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
政府不会对我们开枪
The government will not shoot at us.

145
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
他们可能低估了这个体制
They may have underestimated this system.

146
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
对权力的坚持
Persistence in power

147
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
远远超过了对生命的尊重
Far beyond mere respect for life.

148
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
到了6月初
In early June.

149
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
政府已经做出了决定
The government has made a decision.

150
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
